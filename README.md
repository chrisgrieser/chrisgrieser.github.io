# Info
This repo is the backend of my personal website, <https://chris-grieser.de>.
My website is hosted via GitHub Pages, with domain and DNS provided by
[Strato](https://www.strato.de/). 

- The steps for creating this setup [are described in detail
  here](./setup-description.md).
- I wrote [a small shell script](./report-deployment-status.sh) to continuously
  report the deployment status of via GitHub Pages, and exists once the
  deployment finished. I use this in [my task-runner setup](./Justfile) to
  notify me via sound when the deployment is complete.
