## Background
Academic research on platforms can basically be divided into two areas of study:
On the one hand, platforms are seen as *technical infrastructures* that provide
core functionality for complimentary products, e.g. a mobile operating system
providing camera functionality for a wide range of apps. On the other hand,
platforms are seen as *digital marketplaces* that are controlled by private
firms, e.g., the App Store where the platform operator controls which developers
get access and how the apps are ranked. The conceptual distinction, however,
makes little sense in face of the empirical trend of hybrid platforms that are
characterized by a high relevance of infrastructural services as well as a high
degree of market organization by the platform provider. Therefore, I suggest to
theoretically integrate those two platform concepts by conceptualizing platforms
as organized marketplaces centered around a certain technical infrastructure
where both market and infrastructure are in the control of one entity. This
perspective allows relating insights from research on software platforms with
research on gig economy or dating platforms, as all three are seen as specific
sub-types of platforms only with a different degree to which the infrastructure
or the market organization is relevant (see figure below).

The central research question of my PhD-project is how the specific governance
of digital platforms, which consists of a privately regulated market as well as
governance through a technological infrastructure, enables the technical
innovations on those platforms. Basically, there is an interdependence between
platform and app: you cannot innovate the platform without considering the apps,
and you cannot improve an app without considering the platform. Theoretically,
this technological interdependence results in a high incentive *not* to innovate
any of them as platform providers, as well as app developers are interested in
maintaining compatibility. In practice, however, platforms and apps have very
short and frequent update cycles. My central research hypothesis is that the
idiosyncratic characteristics of the governance of digital platforms enable the
various actors in the field to overcome the theoretical stalemate situation. To
investigate the mechanisms through which platforms and apps coordinate with each
other, I conduct qualitative interviews with app developers, CTOs, and computer
scientists as well as extensive document analyses of several types of field
documents.
